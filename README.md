This is a set of configuration files for Redhat Enterprise Linux (versions 6
and 7) to harden them.  Recursively copy all of the files in a particular
release's directory into /etc to install them by running the setup.sh script.

The v6 files will be coming soon.

Consider the v7 files experimental.  I haven't been able to test them as well
as I would like because of how much has changed since v6.

The configuration changes are taken from the following ebooks and other Git
repositories:

* https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/community/editors/groups/single/?group=redhat
* https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/show-single/?file=apache.310
* https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/show-single/?file=apache24.100
* https://github.com/ioerror/duraconf/

As always, these files are a work in progress.
